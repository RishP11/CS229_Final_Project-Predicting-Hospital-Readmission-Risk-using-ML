## Predicting Hospital Readmission using Machine Learning - _CS 229 Machine Learning Final Project_

_*Abstract:*_
ICU readmissions within 30 days pose sig-
nificant clinical and operational burdens. Using data
from MIMIC-III, we evaluate multiple predictive models
and imputation techniques to predict all-cause 30-day
readmission. Models trained on laboratory values, age,
and ICU stay duration show that gradient-boosted trees
achieve the strongest performance while capturing clinically
meaningful patterns. 

**Note: The data we used for this project is sourced from MIMIC-III database. While it is available for open-use, sharing of the data is not permitted. One needs to complete formal training to access the database. We however, do provide the Queries in the `src` folder that we used to fetch data and curate a cohort.**
